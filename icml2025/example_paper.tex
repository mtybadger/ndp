\begin{abstract}
Autoregressive models have recently become competitive with diffusion-based approaches for image generation. However, these models remain computationally expensive, and fail to surpass the fastest approaches for image generation, such as GANs and distilled diffusion. We present Next-Detail Prediction (NDP), a method for precisely controlling the compute spent generating an image by focusing on difficult-to-predict regions. We achieve this by predicting sequentially higher-resolution patch maps of an image, choosing to upsample difficult patches first. We compare and evaluate several strategies for estimating the difficulty of image patches, and propose a masked architecture that predicts both patches and their difficulty in a single step. We show that this method can generate high-quality images with significantly less compute than previous approaches. On the ImageNet 256x256 Generation benchmark, we achieve state-of-the-art FID and IS 2x faster than baseline AR approaches, and demonstrate desirable scaling with higher resolutions. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

Much has been made of the potential for large language models (LLMs) to generalize to visual data modalities, such as images and video. Vision LLMs, such as GPT-4V, Gemini 1.0, Claude 3 and their derivatives, have shown impressive capabilities in understanding visual data. Advances in image tokenization, particular VQ-VAEs, allow discrete LLM token vocabularies to span text and images. 

However, in deployment, these models do not use their native image tokenizers to generate images. State-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches such as DDPM and DiT remain widely used for image generation, and can be accelerated with methods such as LCM and sCM to generate images in less than a second. Diffusion is aesthetically less desirable than a general multimodal system, and seems not to benefit from the scalability and simplicity of self-supervised next-token prediction, so a high-quality autoregressive (AR) image generation paradigm is desirable.

Until recently, autoregressive models have been less competitive than diffusion for image generation. However, the recent work VAR showed that AR models can generate high-quality images, if asked to predict images in hierarchical scales rather than in raster order. VAR uses a hierarchical VQ-VAE to tokenize images into a sequence of increasingly-large token maps, and predicts these token maps autoregressively. 

VAR cites inspiration from the fact that ``humans percieve or create images in a hierarchical manner, first capturing the global structure and then local details''. We add that humans percieve different parts of images preferentially -- for example, an artist may focus on critical details such as eyes and faces, and spend less effort on background details. Many images in practice contain large regions of low-entropy single colors or patterns, which can be decoded easily. Therefore, we demonstrate that compute-efficiency of AR image models can be improved when they are allowed to focus on difficult-to-predict regions of an image first.

Our NDP model, following VAR, is trained on increasingly large token maps, however it follows a masked upsampling objective - given a $K \times K$ patch, it predicts the 4 $\frac{K}{2}\times\frac{K}{2}$ child patches in the following scale. We train our model to predict these next tokens, and also to predict a difficulty scalar, which is an estimation of the difficulty of each visible patch. We then use this difficulty map to choose which patches to upsample next. We show that this method can generate high-quality images with significantly less compute than previous approaches. We contribute:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel method for precisely controlling the compute spent generating an image by focusing on difficult-to-predict regions.
    \item A comparison of methods for evaluating the difficulty of image patches.
    \item A novel objective that predicts patches and difficulty simultaneously.
    \item A novel tokenizer that decodes tokens of various scales into a single coherent image
\end{itemize}

Our code is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/next-detail-prediction/next-detail-prediction}.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Image Tokenization}

As mentioned, we use a vector-quantized autoencoder to tokenize images similar to VQ-GAN, which is itself derived from VQ-VAE. Additionally, we adopt some architectural ideas from LlamaGen's tokenizer, namely normalizing the embedding space. 


\subsection{Image Generation}



\subsection{Abstract}

The paper abstract should begin in the left column, 0.4~inches below the final
address. The heading `Abstract' should be centered, bold, and in 11~point type.
The abstract body should use 10~point type, with a vertical spacing of
11~points, and should be indented 0.25~inches more than normal on left-hand and
right-hand margins. Insert 0.4~inches of blank space after the body. Keep your
abstract brief and self-contained, limiting it to one paragraph and roughly 4--6
sentences. Gross violations will require correction at the camera-ready phase.

\subsection{Partitioning the Text}

You should organize your paper into sections and paragraphs to help
readers place a structure on the material and understand its
contributions.

\subsubsection{Sections and Subsections}

Section headings should be numbered, flush left, and set in 11~pt bold
type with the content words capitalized. Leave 0.25~inches of space
before the heading and 0.15~inches after the heading.

Similarly, subsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and set
in 10~pt bold type with the content words capitalized. Leave
0.2~inches of space before the heading and 0.13~inches afterward.

Finally, subsubsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and
set in 10~pt small caps with the content words capitalized. Leave
0.18~inches of space before the heading and 0.1~inches after the
heading.

Please use no more than three levels of headings.

\subsubsection{Paragraphs and Footnotes}

Within each section or subsection, you should further partition the
paper into paragraphs. Do not indent the first line of a given
paragraph, but insert a blank line between succeeding ones.

You can use footnotes\footnote{Footnotes
should be complete sentences.} to provide readers with additional
information about a topic without interrupting the flow of the paper.
Indicate footnotes with a number in the text where the point is most
relevant. Place the footnote in 9~point type at the bottom of the
column in which it appears. Precede the first footnote in a column
with a horizontal rule of 0.8~inches.\footnote{Multiple footnotes can
appear in each column, in the same order as they appear in the text,
but spread them across columns and pages if possible.}

Machine Learning Conferences (ICML 1993 -- ICML 2008) and International
Workshops on Machine Learning (ML 1988 -- ML 1992). At the time this figure was
produced, the number of accepted papers for ICML 2008 was unknown and instead
estimated.}
\label{icml-historical}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.2in
\end{figure}

\subsection{Figures}

You may want to include figures in the paper to illustrate
your approach and results. Such artwork should be centered,
legible, and separated from the text. Lines should be dark and at
least 0.5~points thick for purposes of reproduction, and text should
not appear on a gray background.

Label all distinct components of each figure. If the figure takes the
form of a graph, then give a name for each axis and include a legend
that briefly describes each curve. Do not include a title inside the
figure; instead, the caption should serve this function.

Number figures sequentially, placing the figure number and caption
\emph{after} the graphics, with at least 0.1~inches of space before
the caption and 0.1~inches after it, as in
\cref{icml-historical}. The figure caption should be set in
9~point type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which
case it should be flush left. You may float figures to the top or
bottom of a column, and you may set wide figures across both columns
(use the environment \texttt{figure*} in \LaTeX). Always place
two-column figures at the top or bottom of the page.

\subsection{Algorithms}

If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic''
environments to format pseudocode. These require
the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and
algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package.
\cref{alg:example} shows an example.

\begin{algorithm}[tb]
   \caption{Bubble Sort}
   \label{alg:example}
\begin{algorithmic}
   \STATE {\bfseries Input:} data $x_i$, size $m$
   \REPEAT
   \STATE Initialize $noChange = true$.
   \FOR{$i=1$ {\bfseries to} $m-1$}
   \IF{$x_i > x_{i+1}$}
   \STATE Swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
   \STATE $noChange = false$
   \ENDIF
   \ENDFOR
   \UNTIL{$noChange$ is $true$}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Tables}

You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like
figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively.
However, place the title \emph{above} the table with at least
0.1~inches of space before the title and the same after it, as in
\cref{sample-table}. The table title should be set in 9~point
type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which case it
should be flush left.

% Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing
% above and below tabular lines.

Bayes on various data sets.}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{sc}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.1in
\end{table}

Tables contain textual material, whereas figures contain graphical material.
Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
wide tables across both columns. Place two-column tables at the
top or bottom of the page.

\subsection{Theorems and such}
The preferred way is to number definitions, propositions, lemmas, etc. consecutively, within sections, as shown below.
\begin{definition}
\label{def:inj}
A function $f:X \to Y$ is injective if for any $x,y\in X$ different, $f(x)\ne f(y)$.
\end{definition}
Using \cref{def:inj} we immediate get the following result:
\begin{proposition}
If $f$ is injective mapping a set $X$ to another set $Y$, 
the cardinality of $Y$ is at least as large as that of $X$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} 
Left as an exercise to the reader. 
\end{proof}
\cref{lem:usefullemma} stated next will prove to be useful.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:usefullemma}
For any $f:X \to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ injective functions, $f \circ g$ is injective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:bigtheorem}
If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, the cardinality of $X$ and $Y$ are the same.
\end{theorem}
An easy corollary of \cref{thm:bigtheorem} is the following:
\begin{corollary}
If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, 
the cardinality of $X$ is at least as large as that of $Y$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{assumption}
The set $X$ is finite.
\label{ass:xfinite}
\end{assumption}
\begin{remark}
According to some, it is only the finite case (cf. \cref{ass:xfinite}) that is interesting.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Citations and References}

Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic
facility, use \texttt{natbib.sty} and \texttt{icml2025.bst}
included in the style-file package to obtain this format.

Citations within the text should include the authors' last names and
year. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Arthur Samuel's
pioneering work \yrcite{Samuel59}. Otherwise place the entire
reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a
comma \cite{Samuel59}. List multiple references separated by
semicolons \cite{kearns89,Samuel59,mitchell80}. Use the `et~al.'
construct only for citations with three or more authors or after
listing all authors to a publication in an earlier reference \cite{MachineLearningI}.

Authors should cite their own work in the third person
in the initial version of their paper submitted for blind review.
Please refer to \cref{author info} for detailed instructions on how to
cite your own papers.

Use an unnumbered first-level section heading for the references, and use a
hanging indent style, with the first line of the reference flush against the
left margin and subsequent lines indented by 10 points. The references at the
end of this document give examples for journal articles \cite{Samuel59},
conference publications \cite{langley00}, book chapters \cite{Newell81}, books
\cite{DudaHart2nd}, edited volumes \cite{MachineLearningI}, technical reports
\cite{mitchell80}, and dissertations \cite{kearns89}.

Alphabetize references by the surnames of the first authors, with
single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
references for the same authors by year of publication, with the
earliest first. Make sure that each reference includes all relevant
information (e.g., page numbers).

Please put some effort into making references complete, presentable, and
consistent, e.g. use the actual current name of authors.
If using bibtex, please protect capital letters of names and
abbreviations in titles, for example, use \{B\}ayesian or \{L\}ipschitz
in your .bib file.

\section*{Accessibility}
Authors are kindly asked to make their submissions as accessible as possible for everyone including people with disabilities and sensory or neurological differences.
Tips of how to achieve this and what to pay attention to will be provided on the conference website \url{http://icml.cc/}.

\section*{Software and Data}

If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can be
done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, \textbf{do not}
include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
submission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the OpenReview reviewing
system. Note that reviewers are not required to look at this material
when writing their review.

% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
\section*{Acknowledgements}

\textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
the paper submitted for blind review.

If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
sponsors that provided financial support.

\section*{Impact Statement}

Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
as the following will suffice:

``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
paper is later flagged for ethics review.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
\nocite{langley00}
